# Election_analysis_python
## purpose
purpose of this election was ultimatly to get an intro to python and determine and display the winner of the election using given CSV excel data. 
##project resources
In this project we used python and csv, as well as the module and youtube to learn python coding. 

##overview 
purpose of this election was to calculate using python coding who won the elction. there were 3 candidates and we analyzed by county. once we figured this out, we presented the data in a .txt file that is clean and presentable
##summary
the script that I wrote here (with the help of the module) could be used for future elections with minimal modification. you could also modify it to havnlde more CSV. files based on new counties or locations

note: struggled with the county votes calculation, need to revisit at a later date 4.17
